Fuse mind and AI for better communication.

## Overview

Meeting new people on internet chats takes a lot of time. Over time, questions and answers repeat themselves. Typing text messages is time-consuming. Blint helps users have more engaging and productive conversations. The app uses artificial intelligence to suggest a series of questions and answers to users, based on their previous responses. This helps users to keep the conversation flowing and avoid awkward silences.
